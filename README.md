About six cube for 5-round Ketje-Jr, some details are following:
The second cube-attack-like has 15 auxiliary variables and 14 involved keys bits.
Because in the first one cube-attack-like, we have known 24 key information, 
so now we have 10 unknown auxiliary variables and 8 unknown involved keys bits. 
Through the the first two cube-attack-like, we can get a total of 38 key bits.

The third cube-attack-like has 15 auxiliary variables and 18 involved keys bits. 
Because in the first two cube-attack-like, we have known 38 key information, 
so now we have 9 unknown auxiliary variables and 9 unknown involved keys bits.
Through the the first three cube-attack-like, we can get a total of 50 key bits.

The fourth  cube-attack-like has 26 auxiliary variables and 32 involved keys bits. 
Because in the first three cube-attack-like, we have known 50 key information, 
so now we have 1 unknown auxiliary variables and 12 unknown involved keys bits.
Through the the first four cube-attack-like, we can get a total of 63 key bits.

The fifth  cube-attack-like has 16 auxiliary variables and 28 involved keys bits.  
Because in the first four cube-attack-like, we have known 63 key information, 
so now we have 0 unknown auxiliary variables and 7 unknown involved keys bits. 
Through the the first four cube-attack-like, we can get a total of 63 key bits.

The six cube-attack-like has 16 auxiliary variables and 28 involved keys bits.  
Because in the first five cube-attack-like, we have known 63 key information, 
so now we have 0 unknown auxiliary variables and 7 unknown involved keys bits. 
Through the the first five cube-attack-like, we can get a total of 70 key bits.
